## Project Title :- Mushroom_Classifier

## Problem Statement

The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms contains descriptions 
of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom (1981). Each species is labelled as either definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or maybe edible but not recommended. This last category was merged with the toxic category. The Guide asserts unequivocally that there is no simple rule for judging a mushroom's edibility, such as "leaflets three, leave it be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy. 
The main goal is to predict which mushroom is poisonous & which is edible. 

## Approach

- The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.

## Data set 

```bash
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification
```
## Steps

1.  Importing the Liberary
2.  Reading Dataset
3.  Data Preprocessing
4.  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
5.  Handling Categorical as well as Numarical Data
7.  Performing Feature Selection
8.  Model Training 
9.  Making pkl file
10. Testing
11. Production
12. Deployment
